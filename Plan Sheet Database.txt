Use forms in php or asp
database menipulation would be done in action.php or corresponding asp file

search for name in master list
if( is in list )
	add tourney score to name
	update any information on master list that must be updated
	
if( is not on list )
	create table for player
	add tourney info to table
	add player to master player list
	
run the queries when the info is requested. This way it will always do it based on the current date, because which scores are counted is time sensitive

use the same php or asp language to write the report form to be used to access or view player info
would probably have a dropdown menu or a text field to select/type in name
would then run query in a different action.php to calculate the statistical data and print it to screen
